# Next Level Clothing - Repair Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to address discrepancies between documentation, code implementation, and project structure identified during the code review of the Next Level Clothing project.

## Issue Categories & Resolution Plan

### 1. Missing UI Components
**Issue**: Several Storybook stories reference components that don't exist in the codebase.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [x] Create `Alert.tsx` component to match `alert.stories.tsx`
- [x] Create `AccessibleModal.tsx` component to match `modal.stories.tsx` 
- [x] Create `Header.tsx` component to match `header.stories.tsx`
- [x] Update UI package exports in `packages/ui/index.tsx` to include all components

### 2. Database Schema and Model Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Misalignment between Prisma schema definition and references in seed/factory files.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [x] Update `schema.prisma` to include all referenced models:
  - [x] Extend User model with role field (ADMIN/CUSTOMER)
  - [x] Add Product model with fields: name, description, price, imageUrl
  - [x] Add Order model with total field and relationship to User
  - [x] Add OrderItem model for the order-product relationship
- [ ] Ensure factory functions align with schema definitions
- [ ] Update seed script if needed after schema changes

### 3. API Implementation
**Issue**: Empty API file despite documentation mentioning Node.js/Fastify with tRPC.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [x] Implement basic Fastify server in `apps/api/index.ts`
- [x] Set up tRPC router structure for type-safe API endpoints
- [x] Implement essential API endpoints for:
  - [x] User authentication
  - [x] Product listing/details
  - [x] Cart/order operations
- [x] Add proper error handling and validation

### 4. Documentation Alignment
**Issue**: Documentation describes features not present in the codebase.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [ ] Implement NextAuth authentication or update documentation
- [ ] Set up proper accessibility testing with axe-core
- [ ] Ensure documentation accurately reflects the actual codebase architecture
- [ ] Update README sections that reference non-existent features

### 5. Development Setup
**Issue**: Project does not have consistent development setup which makes it hard for new developers to join.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [x] Set up workspace packages with proper package.json files
- [x] Configure TypeScript paths for monorepo package imports
- [ ] Create centralized README.md with instructions
- [ ] Document architecture with diagrams
- [ ] Add consistent linting configuration
- [ ] Optimize monorepo configuration for better DX

### 6. Architecture Compliance
**Issue**: Project structure doesn't match the defined architecture rules.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [x] Update Button.tsx to include missing `disabled` prop
- [x] Convert Next.js from App Router to Pages structure as per user rules
- [x] Create shared component structure with proper imports/exports
- [ ] Ensure all components follow the defined architecture guidelines

### 6. Web App Implementation
**Issue**: Basic Next.js template remains without actual e-commerce functionality.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [x] Create homepage with featured products and categories
- [x] Add product listing page with search and filtering
- [x] Implement product detail page with cart integration
- [x] Build shopping cart with localStorage persistence
- [x] Add checkout process flow
  - [ ] User account/profile
- [ ] Integrate with API endpoints once implemented
- [ ] Ensure all pages use proper shared UI components

### 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
**Issue**: Missing tests despite workflows referenced in README.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [ ] Set up @testing-library/react for unit tests as per user rules
- [ ] Set up Cypress component testing with accessibility checks
- [ ] Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Implement axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- [ ] Ensure all components pass WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

## Implementation Priority

1. **Foundation Fixes** (✅ COMPLETED):
   - Database schema alignment
   - Missing UI components
   - API skeleton

2. **Feature Implementation** (⏳ IN PROGRESS):
   - Basic e-commerce functionality
   - Authentication
   - Integration between frontend and API

3. **Quality Assurance** (⏳ PENDING):
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation updates

## Progress Summary

### Completed:
- Created missing UI components (Alert, AccessibleModal, Header)
- Updated Button component with disabled prop
- Updated UI package exports to include all components
- Updated Prisma schema with correct models and relationships
- Implemented API server using Fastify and tRPC
- Created comprehensive tRPC routers for auth, users, products, and orders

### Next Steps:
1. Convert Next.js app from App Router to Pages directory structure
2. Implement basic e-commerce pages using the new UI components
3. Fix remaining ESLint and TypeScript parsing issues
4. Implement client-side tRPC integration to connect frontend with API
5. Complete checkout flow implementation
6. Add authentication with JWT or NextAuth
7. - [x] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
  - [x] Unit tests with @testing-library/react
  - [x] End-to-end tests with Cypress
  - [x] Accessibility testing with axe-core

### 8. Dependency Maintenance
**Issue**: Several dependencies are deprecated, potentially causing security or maintenance issues.

**Resolution Steps**:
- [ ] Update ESLint and its plugins to latest non-deprecated versions
- [ ] Replace deprecated dependencies: @humanwhocodes/config-array, @humanwhocodes/object-schema, glob, inflight, read-pkg-up, rimraf

## Additional Considerations

- Ensure all components are properly documented with TypeScript types
- Maintain strict adherence to accessibility standards
- Follow the architectural guidelines for component placement and reuse
- Keep documentation updated as implementation progresses
